Thanks to Thenior for the explosions, and shield animation!
Thanks to Skizot for your l33t google'ing skills and finding me new water, making an alpha layer for the water, and for the sandy terrain!
Thanks to DeDilus for his license advice!
Thanks to everyone else in #XNA on choopa.net for all your coding help, and advice!
